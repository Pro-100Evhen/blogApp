This project is a demo application designed to teach you the basics of working with React and modern ecosystem tools. The application uses React Router to create separate pages and routing, which ensures smooth navigation between different parts of the interface. Asynchronous data retrieval is implemented using createAsyncThunk from the Redux Toolkit, which allows for efficient interaction with the API. Tailwind CSS was used to create an adaptive and stylish interface, which simplifies the work with the design and allows you to quickly implement design components. The main goal of the project is to develop skills in working with routing, asynchronous requests, and modern state management methods in React, as well as integrating styling with Tailwind.
